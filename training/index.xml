      <description>January 28
Mid January I have received the long awaited Xeon ergometer. I am amazed! Even the blisters that I get from using it are in the same spots as where I usually get them while paddling a real kayak.
I started to map the session on the ergo with the distances and the PEI map. Hopefully will give me a clear idea of how this plan is going to work.</description>
