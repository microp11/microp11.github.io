      <description>Provisions&#xA;Same as with the equipment, the aim is to be self-sufficient for the entire trip, and only the water should need replenishing.&#xA;Based on the dry-run, for a 10+h day paddle I would need about 3k calories. Adding to that the 2.5k for the average male body, it seems that 5.5k calories a day would be a good guess. The food will be organized in individual 1-day packs.</description>

      <description>By far the biggest hazard on this trip is paddling alone and I strongly believe that I am prepared.&#xA;Emergency contacts:&#xA;VHF channel 16 *16 on mobile in Atlantic Canada takes you directly to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) Halifax 911 Coast Guard Toll-free: 1-800-565-1582 Telephone: 902-427-8200 Personal In terms of geography, there are areas on this trip where there are high cliffs and it is impossible to land.</description>

      <description>With the goal clear in my mind, first step was to figure out &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo;. I think that for PEI, the months of June and July are the best for a multi-day paddle. The waters start warming up, there are no bugs, it is not excessively warm which means that there is no significant weather either, and the daylight time is at its longest.&#xA;The next step was to see which way to proceed: clockwise or counter-clockwise.</description>

      <description>For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating Prince Edward Island in a sea kayak. There are roughly around 300 nautical miles (555 km) if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.&#xA;A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:</description>
