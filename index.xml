      <description>DRAFT By far the biggest hazard on this trip is paddling alone. This needs special considerations.
And then&amp;hellip;
One needs escape routes or areas to get off the water if the conditions deteriorate. One also needs to know where one can land. Many beaches are exposed to open ocean and may have dangerous surf, making landing impossible. What if the wind comes up? What if I need to call for help?</description>

      <description>For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating Prince Edward Island in a sea kayak. There are roughly around 300 nautical miles (555 km) if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.
A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:</description>
