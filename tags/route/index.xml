      <description>With the goal clear in my mind, first step was to figure out &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo;. I think that for PEI, the months of June and July are the best for a multi-day paddle. The waters start warming up, there are no bugs, it is not excessively warm which means that there is no significant weather either, and the daylight time is at its longest.
The next step was to see which way to proceed: clockwise or counter-clockwise.</description>
