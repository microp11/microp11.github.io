      <description>DRAFT For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating Prince Edward Island in a sea kayak. There are around 300 nautical miles if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.
A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:
William Arthur &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Reddin and dog Bozo (1934-1935), canoe, counter-clockwise Wendy Killoran (May-June 2005), 15 days, clockwise Joseph Simmonds, teen, sea kayak (August 2016), 12 days, counter-clockwise Annette Boerlage, sea kayak, (TODO) Douglas Russell and Colin Hudson, SUP (June 2020), 12 days, clockwise The purpose of the trip is to challenge oneself, enjoy and explore.</description>
